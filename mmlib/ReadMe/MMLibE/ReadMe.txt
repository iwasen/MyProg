 Introduction
**************************************************
Thank you very much for downloading Multimedia library Manager (MMLIB).

There are many magazine reports, documents, etc. accumulated in office or house. Progress of the latest software makes it possible to store them to your own personal computer.
A tool for that is "Multimedia Library (MMLIB)."
It may be slightly exaggerated to call it "electronic filing." It is an easy and convenient tool for arranging, keeping and distributing picture information around you.

MMLIB has the following functions.
* In addition to picture, text data can also be treated simultaneously.
* Import of the picture is available directly from the image scanner or the digital camera with TWAIN drivers.
* Import of the picture from the video camera is also available (only the still picture).
* The security function by password setup and access restrictions.
* The high-speed keyword search function.
* Cooperation with other arbitrary picture software (OCR software, retouch software, etc.) is supported (data transfer function).
* An exclusive picture viewer (MMLIB Viewer) is prepared.
* Cooperation with MS Outlook is supported (send mail function).
* With the network version, picture information is sharable on a remote server's HDD.
* With the network version, the picture read at once can be saved into cache.
(As for the network version, please ask to shop@xxxx.com)
